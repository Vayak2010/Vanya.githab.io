      <h4>Driver Easy</h4>

<p>Driver Easy is a system tool that allows you to always have the latest versions of drivers for installed hardware on your PC. As you know, without a driver one or another PC component may work unstably, incorrectly or not function at all. In this case, it is important to have the latest versions of the driver, because the developers of the equipment correct errors, vulnerabilities and conflicts with other devices.


The program will help you install the necessary drivers quickly and without a tedious search on the Internet. Install this application, run a system scan, get a report on the found equipment and information about its driver and start the installation (update) of the driver. Both automatic one-click installation of all found drivers and manual installation, when you decide what needs to be updated and what doesn't, are available.


The free version of the application allows you to install only 1 driver at a time, and also has a limited driver download speed. The Pro version has no such limitations and has additional tools to manage your drivers - backup, restore, uninstall and others.


In general, Driver Easy is a useful application that will simplify your task of finding and installing drivers when reinstalling your system, formatting your hard disk, buying new hardware and other situations.</p>
